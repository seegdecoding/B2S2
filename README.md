# CerebroVoice: A Stereotactic EEG Dataset and Benchmark for Bilingual Brain-to-Speech Synthesis and Activity Detection
**CerebroVoice** is the first publicly available stereotactic EEG (sEEG) dataset designed for bilingual brain-to-speech synthesis and voice activity detection (VAD). The dataset includes neural recordings collected while two bilingual participants (Mandarin and English speakers) read aloud Chinese Mandarin words, English words, and Chinese Mandarin digits. This dataset enables research into brain-to-speech synthesis, bilingual speech decoding, and voice activity detection from sEEG signals.
This repository provides the dataset, benchmarks, and code for running experiments on bilingual brain-to-speech synthesis using the **Mixture of Bilingual Synergy Experts (MoBSE)** framework, as well as for voice activity detection (VAD) using standard EEG models.
